## Player Dashboard
> [!abstract]+ Hook
>Setting:
>- Medieval 'low magic' fantasy - On the planet of Veylis
>- Magic in this world is known as [[3-World/The Vey\|The Vey]]
>- The world experiences sudden earthquakes that cause global tsunamis. Each civilization exists with natural or man-made barriers that can protect them from these "Tempests". More information can be found in [[3-World/World Timeline\|World Timeline]] and [[3-World/Weather\|Weather]]
>
> At one point in time you were just a commoner with a mundane job. That changed when Varrick entered your life. Through some means he showed you that you and everyone you know are capable of so much more. You became an adventurer; the only calling in life that could offer you what you now needed.
> 
> You had some adventures of your own and in time you grew to know yourself and the Vey. Religious folk shun or at least avoid the use of the Vey. Most folk are religious. Luckily, aside from the flamboyant spells of Mages, most people don't know the Vey when they see it. Instead choosing to believe a thief simply is exceptionally inconspicuous, or that a barbarian is simple exceptionally strong. If they only knew what you did.
>  
>  That brings us today. The funeral of your mentor Varrick.

> [!NOTE]- Idea
> This page will have links to all player visible information and maybe widgets to display current stats, summary of latest session journal, and places or NPCs recently interacted with, current goals, etc.
