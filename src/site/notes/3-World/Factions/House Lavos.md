### Faction Type: School

This culture is formed around a government. A city-state, it exists to provide protection, structure, and organization for the citizens living within them. Bonds between members are defined by political frameworks and civic structures.

Currently the city is governed by a council of merchants, foremen, artisans, and professors dubbed the "Council of Bastion"

### A Faction of Knowledge

Bastion is a prideful nation that celebrates a the strength of it's people. Their are known for their ideals of achievement and pushing the boundaries of industry. Their architecture is known the world round with the Embassy of Thorns being it's crown achievement. It is law that no other building in the nation may be taller than the Embassy.

> [!EXAMPLE]- Other Achievements
> - The Tempered Mines whose efficiency is ensured by cutting edge machinery
> - The architecture of Bastion Keep and the various homes within the town center.
> - The greatest ships designed in the Cradled Isles
> - Their University allows for many people from many nations to find their strengths

The people hold themselves and their peers in high regard and subscribe to an ideal view of education, work ethic, and study. Sadly this can also lead to those who are unable to contribute to this ideal being forgotten; cast away by society. Those who are deemed to show no ambition or suffer from depression are considered wasted talent. These undesirables often live in tents in the forests to the east of town.

### Treasure: Embassy of Thorns (Structure)

This Embassy was built on an island in the basin of the Thorned Peaks. It was built by various people from across the Cradled Isles who call the city of Bastion home. Hopeful their creation would unite the Cradled Nations towards common goals, the building stands as a testament to the best intentions of society made manifest.

### Treasure: Pure Iron (Rarity)

Due to the properties of the Thorned Peaks, a treasure of pure iron veins line the mines established by the government of Bastion. This material is prized as the best iron in the world because of its purity. Unbeknownst to anyone, this is due to the Observer's xeno-forming in the area going awry centuries ago.

### Relationships

Bastion can find respect in any nation that works to serve a greater purpose. This could be Industry, Art, Culture, etc. However they take great offense at those would would exploit others to achieve greatness. The believe fully in the ideal that an educated and celebrated people create the best works.

They fully believe that their greatest rival (and threat) is the Veyrüm Empire. Their industrious rise and conquering of their continent leaves them unmatched in strength and industry. Now that rumors are spreading that the Auctisian navy has developed ships capable of navigating through the Tempests of the Sundered Seas, the Council of Bastion has made Veyrüm their top priority.
