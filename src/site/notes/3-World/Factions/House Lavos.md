# House Lavos - Stewards of Science and History

![lavosbanner.png|300](/img/user/z_Assets/lavosbanner.png)

### Faction Type: School

This culture is formed around an institution designed to study and instruct a particular subject or practice. Schools exist to collect and pass on knowledge, and some evaluate worth of members.

House Lavos is the world's largest gathering of historians, archeologists, and natural philosophers. Our aim is to promote free learning in all its forms. We provide the single largest public library and humanities display in the Cradled Isles located in the heart of Bastion. We call it the Anthroporium.

### A Faction of Knowledge

My brother and I have a new ambition for our House. Our forebearers worked to pursue this dream within the constrains of Bastion society. They asked of us, without our wealth how could they help others? They feared being ostracized and refused to take the necessary leap. In this last decade we have worked to go beyond this. To forego future monetary gain and to replace it with prosperity in the present. It is now the belief of House Lavos that knowledge should be shared freely to all humanity.

It is undeniable that most of our peers dismiss our Houses pursuits. Not only the noble houses but the population at large. At best, they see our work as unprofitable. At worst, they see as a secular sect of heretics. That being said, we have seen an increase in interest from third parties in recent years. Especially from adventurers guilds outside of Bastion.

### Treasure: The Anthroporium (Structure)

The Anthroporium has become a base of operations for our house. Beyond the library, museum, and laboratory, it is equipped with a grand dining room, bedrooms, meeting room, and even a grand ballroom. It is the prized jewel of our house and no expense was spared in its construction.

### Treasure: Anthropologists (People)

Although many see our pursuit as pointless, there are yet a few who see our mission as vital. Over the years we have taken on many curious individuals and helped further their education. Those prospects who might have not had the opportunities to pay for Bastion's private education come to us. Of those who learn from us, many choose to stay and pass on what they have learned to others. We pride ourselves as a "House of many Houses".

### Relationships

As of now we cannot claim ourselves to be one of the major factions on Veylis. There is a distinct and uncomfortable judgement when other Noble Houses bring up our name. That being said Bastion is still our birthplace and our home. Despite what individuals may say, Bastion as a whole still puts ambition above all else, and there is no one here who doubts our Ambition. Flawed as they may say it is.
