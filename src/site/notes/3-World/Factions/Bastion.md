# Bastion - The City of Possibilities

![bastion_city_map.png](/img/user/z_Assets/bastion_city_map.png)

### Faction Type: State

This culture is formed around a government. A city-state, it exists to provide protection, structure, and organization for the citizens living within them. Bonds between members are defined by political frameworks and civic structures.

Currently the city is governed by a council of merchants, foremen, artisans, and professors dubbed the "Council of Bastion"

### A Faction of Ambition

Bastion is a prideful nation that celebrates the strength of its people. Their are known for their ideals of achievement and pushing the boundaries of industry. Their architecture is known the world round with the Embassy of Thorns being it's crown achievement. It is law that no other building in the nation may be taller than the Embassy.

The people hold themselves and their peers in high regard and subscribe to an ideal view of education, work ethic, and study. These ideals however aren't some grand gesture. All that is done is done in the pursuit of profit and grandeur. Sadly this has lead to those who are unable to contribute to this ideal being forgotten; cast away by society. Those who are deemed to show no ambition or suffer from depression are considered wasted talent. These undesirables often live in tents in the forests to the east of town.

### Treasure: Embassy of Thorns (Structure)

This Embassy was built on an island in the basin of the Thorned Peaks. It was built by various people from across the Cradled Isles who call the city of Bastion home. Hopeful their creation would unite the Cradled Nations towards common goals, the building stands as a testament to the best intentions of society made manifest.

### Treasure: Orichalcum - Immortal Iron (Rarity)

Due to the properties of the Thorned Peaks, a treasure of orichalcum veins line the mines established by the government of Bastion. Also known as "Immortal Iron", orichalcum has the unique property of never rusting and never dulling once sharpened. A pure orichalcum sword is a prized possession passed down generations of noble houses lucky enough to have one. Unfortunately smithing the metal is a herculean task and any mistakes render the iron "mortal". This process is called "casting down" and, although the metal loses its "immortal" characteristics, it is still a pure and lustrous metal. More than 90% of the Immortal Iron mined is ultimately cast down and used as fine weaponry, fixtures, and baubles commonly bought by noble houses.

### Relationships

Bastion can find respect in any nation that works to serve a greater purpose. This could be Industry, Art, Culture, etc. This is assuming the nation also has ambition to use these resources to turn a profit. In the eyes of many in Bastion, a lack of ambition is the key sign of a primitive society. 

They fully believe that their greatest rival (and threat) is the Veyrüm Empire. Their industrious rise and conquering of their continent leaves them unmatched in strength and industry. Now that rumors are spreading that the Auctisian navy has developed ships capable of navigating through the Tempests of the Sundered Seas, the Council of Bastion has made Veyrüm their top priority.
