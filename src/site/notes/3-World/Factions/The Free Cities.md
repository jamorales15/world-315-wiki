1# The Free Cities - Community of Communes

![freecities.png](/img/user/z_Assets/freecities.png)

### Faction Type: Clan

This culture blurs the line between many structures but especially that between family and state, creating affiliation by shared history and values. The bonds here are strongly tied to personal identity.

The Free Cities are "organized" in separate Anarcho-Communist communes with a shared cultural identity. They all "mostly" speak the same language, share the same currency, and follow the same religion. Each commune is self-sustaining and is free to manage itself.

### A Faction of Communication

The Free Cities are only possible because of their pursuit of communicating effectively with one another. They firmly believe that it is their communication and understanding of one another's circumstances is the "seed" that sows the "crop" of peace and art. Unlike the bustling industrial cities of Bastion or Auctus, the individual Free Cities have time for things other than the pursuit of work. What time they don't spend attending to their own farms, they spend following individual pursuits. This has made the Free Cities a leader in culture and the arts.

> [!EXAMPLE]- Other Achievements
> - The Balancing Lotus, A great work of art in the Strong Hall. Finely crafted and needing constant tuning, it is a metal Lily almost impossible balanced on the point a thin rapier.
> - The People's Guard of the Strong Hall are dressed in resplendent clothing of red and yellow that appear to be mostly ceremonial. However it is said that would-be intruders who breach the Strong Hall walls are never seen again
> - The Reservoir is the largest project of its kind in the isles. It provides all of the necessary irrigation needed to power their agrarian society and economy.

Beyond their gifted artisans, the Free Cities is an integral source of food for Bastion. As Bastion itself does not have significant farmable land, it relies on trade with the Free Cities to feed it's ever densely growing city. For the Free Cities, this trade is not the largest, but is the most stable source of income for their communes.

### Treasure: Reservoir (Structure/Place)

Built by damning the bisecting river, the reservoir is of the utmost importance to the Free Cities. It provides the ability to farm all of the land to capacity and also offers drinking water and indoor plumbing to all. The act of damning the river was seen as a hostile act by the Druids. To the east of the reservoir is a large flooded area where the druids successfully blew a hole in the reservoir. More explosions would have gone off but they were found in time by the People's Guard.

### Treasure: Espionage (Skill)

One of the strangest stereotypes of the Cradled Isles is the one cast upon the simple villager from the Free Cities. It is said that at night, after a day of toiling on the land, they wake to sharpen their farming tools and sneak into the night. In hushed corners of taverns in Bastion, travelers recount their sightings of strangely cloaked men and women with sickles in hand leaping across rooftops, gliding through the tall grass, and silently creeping through windows. It is mostly taken as a racist caricature of a people who outwardly value peace. However, none can disagree on one point. Any nobleman of the Idles who speaks harm to the Free Cities one week ends up recanting their statement the following week.

### Relationships

Even before the Reservoir incident, the Free Cities were not on the best terms with the Druids. They certainly are not on speaking terms any longer. It is also no secret that the wood of the Druids' forest is prized for it's soft texture and resplendent color. It is bought by many an artist from the Free Cities, even if through black market channels.

Bastion and the Free Cities have a symbiotic relationship. They sell food to Bastion and Bastion and Bastion sells them the greatest merchant vessels in the Isles.
