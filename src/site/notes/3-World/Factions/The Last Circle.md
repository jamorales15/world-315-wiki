# The Last Circle of the Violet Weald

![violetweald.png](/img/user/z_Assets/violetweald.png)

### Faction Type: Family

This faction is dedicated to acting as stewards and servants of natural forces. They are known to live in a wild and hostile place and to enact retribution when other factions harm their natural world.

The faction of druids is known as the Last Circle while their forest home is known as the Violet Weald or the Bruised Woods by some.

### A Faction of Nature

To the outside world, the Last Circle appears to be the final remnants of a society many dismiss as being "primitive". Though reclusive, there have been enough accounts of their powerful magic that most give the Violet Weald a wide berth. Followers of nearly all Ingenium sects believe the Last Circle to be heretics who have gone crazy from the temptation of power. Better left to their own devices. It was with great pushback that the Embassy of Thorns allowed the Last Circle a seat at the embassy. The final vote to pass the resolution came from our own House Lavos.

> [!EXAMPLE]- Other Achievements
> - Not much is known about the cultural achievements of the Last Circle
> - What can be said is their society is beautiful and seemingly immune to the weathering of time

The Last Circle is an isolationist society. Most of what is known of their culture has come from past military as well as scientific expeditions. Each of which are seen as acts of aggression by the Druids. Though they hold a seat at the Embassy of Thorns, it is rare to see an ambassador in attendance. The last known appearance was by Chief Lotheria in regards to Seachaven's plans to build a reservoir between their lands. Her concerns were met with deaf ears.

### Treasure: Oasis (Place)

Supposedly, an ancient pool secluded on a small island just east of the Violet Weald. It is surround by a stone structure that appears supernaturally engulfed in fog. All previous expeditions to sail into the area have never returned.  All we have are accounts from some druids sympathetic to House Lavos's cause. They describe a body of water that glows an ethereal blue at night and bestows magical gifts. These claims that it grants great insight and healing are, as of now, unverified.

### Treasure: Purple Heart Lumber (Rarity)

It cannot be understated the value of Purple Heart as a material for crafting. Its beauty is unmatched. It is extremely malleable when being crafted and yet is completely immune to weathering. Its most unique property is that it does not burn. Instead fire hardens the wood so that it takes permanent shape. In fact, the last step of crafting with Purple Heart usually involves throwing it into a pit of flame so that it may be preserved forever.

### Relationships

Current events have created an uneasy strain between the Seachaven League and the Last Circle. The Last Circle, along with House Lavos, were in sole objection of a Seachaven reservoir impeding the river running through their lands. This objection failed, the reservoir was built. Last month a bomb was set off on the western side of the reservoir killing dozens and injuring far more. The Last Circle has not claimed guilt but has also refused summons to the Embassy of Thorns for questioning. Our own House Lavos has not been able to get in contact with out liaisons within the Circle since the incident.

Our own House Lavos is perhaps the Last Circle's greatest supporter. It was our convincing of the Council of Bastion to publicly endorse the instatement of The Last Circle that lead to them having a seat on the Embassy of Thorns. We share a deep reverence of history and the laws of nature. However, as was said, our liaisons within the faction have gone silent.
