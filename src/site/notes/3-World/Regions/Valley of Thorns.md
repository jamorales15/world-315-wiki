So named because of the impassable mountain range sheltering it. The peaks are unnaturally spiked on top without any plateau.

- Home of 3 Kingdoms each populated by a majority of followers of Pax Ingenium
- A crescent mountain range surrounds nearly all sides of the Valley of Thorns
	- The snow atop the mountains gives an ethereal blue glow and it's waters flow down in a mist before condensing into a waterfall leading to the which pools in lake around which is built a kingdom of industry.
	- A river floats out of the valley and into a more open space that leads to a forest on one side and a flood plain on the other.
		- These are the other two kingdoms. One agrarian, one druidic.
