- Home of 3 Kingdoms each populated by a majority of followers of Pax Ingenium
- A crescent mountain range surrounds nearly all sides of the Valley of Thorns
	- The snow atop the mountains gives an ethereal blue glow and it's waters flow down in a mist before condensing into a waterfall leading to the which pools in lake around which is built a kingdom of industry.
	- The water that flows from the mountain is particularly pure as if it is filtered by the mountain. It is highly valued as a luxury  base for potions and alchemical magics.
	- A river floats out of the valley and into a more open space that leads to a forest on one side and a flood plain on the other.

- To the southwest of the mountain lies an Agrarian kingdom of farmers including animal husbandry. They are known for their large and unusually intelligent horses.
- To the southeast of the mountain lies a druidic forest kingdom of artisans.
- The Valley of Thorns themselves act as a natural defense against the Tempests from the north. This grants to Kingdoms here unique and privileged protection again the aftershocks.
