So named because of the impassable mountain range sheltering it. The peaks are unnaturally spiked on top without any plateau.

- Home of 3 Kingdoms each populated by a majority of followers of Paxas Ingenium
- To the southwest of the mountain lies an Agrarian kingdom of farmers including animal husbandry. They are known for their large and unusually intelligent horses. They are also secretly home to the greatest guild of assassins in the Remidira.
- To the southeast of the mountain lies a druidic forest kingdom of artisans and craftsmen. Their inner circle are a group of night worshipping shape shifters.
- The mountain range acts as a natural defense against the Tempest, including the original Mother of Tempests which gave the mountains their  jagged appearance.
- Embassy of Thorns - A magnificent building on a small island in the center of the crescent mountain range where the 3 kingdoms meet to discuss politics.
