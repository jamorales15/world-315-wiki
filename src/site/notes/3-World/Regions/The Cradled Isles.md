So named because of the impassable mountain range sheltering it. The peaks are unnaturally spiked on top without any plateau.

- Home of 3 Kingdoms each populated by a majority of followers of Paxas Ingenium
- To the west of the mountain lies an Agrarian kingdom of farmers including animal husbandry. They are known for their large and unusually intelligent horses. They are also secretly home to the greatest guild of assassins in the Veylis.
- Further west, past a river and large hills, lies a druidic forest kingdom of artisans and craftsmen. Their inner circle are a group of night worshipping shape shifters.
- The mountain range acts as a natural defense against the Tempest, including the original Mother of Tempests which gave the mountains their  jagged appearance.
- Embassy of Thorns - A magnificent building on a small island in the center of the crescent mountain range where the 3 kingdoms meet to discuss politics. A bridge of stone was built between the Industrial Kingdom and the Island to further establish themselves as the "Host" kingdom for the Embassy.
	-  Nearby the island are three small rock formations each topped with grand statues of the mascots of the kingdoms. The Eagle, the Lotus, and the Bear.
- To the North west of the castle town of the Agrarian Kingdom lies a wasteland of Outsider Xeno-forming.
