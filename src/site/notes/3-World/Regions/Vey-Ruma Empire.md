The Vey-Ruma empire spans an entire continent which they have conquered. The actual city state of Vey-Ruma, is situated to the east of the continent and is resplendent with the most industrious architecture in the world.

Long ago, The old city of Vey-Ruma was continually attacked by flooding due to it's location below sea level. The value of their mines was deemed to great so, rather than move and let someone else have access, they created a new city situated high above the land via stone marvels of engineering and magic. This causes the city to resemble a city on massive columns earning it the nickname, The City of Spires. Serendipitously, when the massive earthquake caused The Mother of Tempests Vey-Ruma was the only kingdom saved of any damage. This led to them being able to easily conquer what was left of the continent either by force, or by offering to use their magics to create barriers for their vassal states if they swore fealty to the Vey-Ruma crown and the Verum Ingenium religion.
