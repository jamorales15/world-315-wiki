Mock-up world map. Should have an alien archipelago of alien islands in the center of the ocean with concentric waves of current coming from it. This was once a great continent but was completely destroyed in the massive earthquake 50 years ago. This great earthquake completely swallowed the lost continent and caused multiple rounds of massive Tsunamis to emanate outwards. Several huge rounds of towering tsunamis destroyed many trade routes and natural landmarks as well as unearthing hidden Outsider structures and marshland covered by millennia of earth. This great round of waves is known as The Mother of Tempests. It still gives off aftershocks to this day which cause tsunamis around the world though they pale in comparison to the original. These are sometimes referred to as the "Mother's angry children".
