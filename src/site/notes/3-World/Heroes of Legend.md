The Nexum Ingenium in its rudimentary tableaus and its deciphered text shows us that a group of our ancestors went to confront the Outsiders in some way around 500 years ago. These 5 individuals were hence named the "Heroes of Legend".

This confrontation ultimately led to the Mother of Tempests. A massive seismic explosion unlike anything Veylis has experienced since. The Outsiders and the Heroes of Legend were obliterated in the event. Their sacrifice is remembered by all.

These heroes had been known to the ancestors before the events of the Mother of Tempests. It seems they were adventurers in their time. Going place to place helping those in need. Ironically, their mighty status as skilled warriors would be shunned by people of most religious sects today.
