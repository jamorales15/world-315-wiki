### What exactly *is* the Vey?
The Vey is an extrapolation of many things. Will, Faith, Wisdom, Self-Perception to name a few. Most importantly it is **not** an omnipresent external entity (like the Force from Star Wars). Instead it **innately** exists in living things. No individual can pull from another's Vey. Each person's Vey is uniquely their own. It is especially potent in sapient beings capable of intent. It is up to each individual to define and perceive their Vey for themselves or ignore it all together.

#### Source
All living beings born on Veylis have the extraordinary gift of being a source of their own personal Vey. It can be cultivated further in many different ideological pursuits. The ideology also affects how it manifests in the physical world.
