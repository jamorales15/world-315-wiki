# Magic System

### What exactly *is* the Vey?
The Vey is an extrapolation of many things. Will, Faith, Wisdom, Self-Perception to name a few. Most importantly it is **not** an omnipresent external entity (like the Force from Star Wars). Instead it **innately** exists in living things. No individual can pull from another's Vey. Each person's Vey is uniquely their own. It is especially potent in sapient beings capable of intent. It is up to each individual to define and perceive their Vey for themselves or ignore it all together.


> [!ATTENTION]+ Highest Rule of Vey
> It is IMPOSSIBLE to directly affect another's Vey with your own. Another's Vey can only be tampered with by mundane means. Persuasion towards another ideology, Torture to break one's will, conversion to another faith, studying under different schools of thought, etc.
> 
> Furthermore, only living things have Vey and this means only living things can produce magic. This means there are no such things as enchanted items like swords or artifacts.
>> [!EXAMPLE]- Examples
>> - You cannot simply drink a potion and be granted abilities
>> - You cannot simply read from a scroll to cast a fireball

##### Source
All living beings born on Veylis have the extraordinary gift of being a source of their own personal Vey. It can be cultivated further in many different ideological pursuits. The ideology also affects how it manifests in the physical world.
<br>

#####  Cost
Time, patience, self-discipline. The Vey, no matter what ideology the holder wields, must take years of self-reflection and continued effort for it to manifest into something significant. 
<br>

##### Potency
The potency is determined, to a degree, by the wielder's ideology. A mage who believe that the study of natural principles are the path to enlightenment may have strikingly obvious powers over the elements.  
  
However, what truly gives power to a wielder of Vey is how their ideology gives them a sense of self-actualization. Those who come to understand the Vey itself and it's validity as their own "self-determination" become capable of the most astounding feats.
<br>

##### Commonality and Accessibility
EVERY living being on Veylis has access to the Vey. But nearly no one understands it as the manifestation of "self-actualization" that it is. In the same way that no one in our mundane world can tell you "who you are", no one can explain the Vey to someone else. They can guide them towards the path but it is up to each individual to find it for themselves.

It is important to note that a large, yet still minority, portion of the population are basically magical luddites who shun Mages or those who show supernatural powers of any kind. It is common for Mages to not be granted access to businesses in certain parts of the world. The vast majority of people, though not luddites, are still laypeople without any real interest in the Vey beyond religious ceremonies in church. Their day to day lives demand too much from them to ponder any further.

A majority of the population still holds onto the belief that the Vey is something to be suppressed and not wielded. It is much like "original sin" in Christianity.
