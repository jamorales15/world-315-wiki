The planet of Remidira finds itself in a unique and extremely rare "Figure 8" binary star pattern. The planet is passed between the two suns in a figure 8 pattern much like a ball being sling shot back and forth. This causes the weather on Remidira to be temperate nearly year round. And yet it still has a clear day-night cycle. Whatever sun the planet isn't currently orbiting appears much like our moon on earth, albeit a bit brighter. There are months where parts of the planet are facing away from both stars at night or when one sun block the view of the other during the day.

It should also be noted that no other stars can be seen in the night sky. This means that when facing away from the sun the sky is mostly pitch black except for various nebulous gases and icy comets that might be reflected in the night sky.
