Due to the unique figure 8 [[3-World/Binary Star System\|Binary Star System]] the planet fines itself in, the weather on Remidira is temperate all year round and yet there is  clear day night cycle.

Due to the massive earthquake 50 years prior, known as the "Mother of Tempests", there has be a seismic shift the in the planets tectonic structure. Emanating from the sunken continent, aftershocks known as "Tempests" still rage on and create large almost tsunami-like crashing waves about once every fortnight if not earlier. They are hard to precisely predict and many kingdoms noble houses have an in-house group of servants whose sole purpose is to see the signs of an eminent aftershock. These organizations are universally known as the Tellers of the Tempest but most refer to them simply as Tellers.

Most aquatic travel is done through short journeys along a coast, however the Vey-Ruma Empire has recently developed ships of metal that are said to be able to venture the open seas even during a Tempest.
