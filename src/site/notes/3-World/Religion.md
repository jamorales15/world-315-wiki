# Religion - The Vey

## Nexum Ingenium
The teaching that power comes innately from all individuals. This well of internal power they call [[3-World/The Vey\|The Vey]]. It's most sacred text, the Nexus Ingenium, starts with the telling of the overthrow of the Outsiders by the [[3-World/Heroes of Legend\|Heroes of Legend]]. The Outsiders had lured the ancestors with promises of powers from beyond and once tempted, used it to enslave them. Sadly this has devolved over the eons into different sects who view all foreigners as outsiders that may tempt their people with strange new ideas. A fear of one's own Vey overtaking their thoughts with the lust of power has become a fearmongering sermon shouted in nearly all lands. This has lead to much complacency in a large portion of the population. In other words, the Vey in current times is viewed in the same way as "original sin" is viewed in Christianity.
  
The tablet known as the Nexus Ingenium was found 400 years ago and translated as best it could from the pictures alone. 200 years ago a kind of Rosetta Stone was found for the Outsider language and was used to translate the tablet's words. Trying to rectify their legends and this new writing, scholars and theologians of the time created the Nexum Ingenium. The scripture said to translate the history they lost 500 years ago when the Mother of Tempests nearly destroyed all of humanity. However, just 50 years ago, after an earthquake new tablets were found, with no one willing to share their piece to complete the whole. With each society interpreting it differently. This has led the Nexus Ingenium to branch off into conflicting ideologies. Each using these new tablets to reinterpret the original Nexus Ingenium. Branching sects include the Paxas Ingenium and the Rüm Ingenium.

### Paxas Ingenium
A sect that believes that the Outsiders were not inherently evil but that the ancestors let greed and lust for power turn them into murderers. They misused the Outsider's technology and their own Vey and it led to a mutual destruction of the outsiders as well as most of the ancestors civilization. They wanted to learn from their hubris and chose to live their lives to promote inner peace and prosperity for all. This 'peace' however is strictly adhered to and any who show any lust for knowledge or power beyond their station are shunned. Mages in particular are seen as unholy people who tempt others with their displays of the Vey.

### Rüm Ingenium
Those who interpret the inherent strength in people as originating from a select few. This manifests as sorcerers of magic. Additionally the ancestors specifically from the region that would become Veyrüm are believed to be the first mages that overthrew the tyrannical Outsiders. This would mean all who hail from the [[3-World/Regions/Veyrüm Empire\|Veyrüm Empire]] and who possess magic are chosen people who will lead humanity into a new age. All others are lesser, or worse, heretics.

The complete lack of casualties or damage at the hand of the Mother of Tempests was used as proof of Veyrüm's ordained superiority. This became the basis for their new religious doctrine after the first new tablets were excavated and translated.
