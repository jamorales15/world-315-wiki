## Nexus Ingenium
The teaching that power comes innately from all individuals. It's most sacred text, the Nexus Ingenium, starts with the telling of the overthrow of the Outsiders who lured the ancestors with promises of powers from beyond and once tempted, used it to enslave them. Sadly this has devolved over the eons into different sects who view all foreigners as outsiders that may tempt their people with strange new ideas.
The tablet known as the Nexus Ingenium was found 300 years ago and translated as best it could however 50 years ago after an earthquake new tablets were found that act as incomplete Rosetta Stones, with no one willing to share their piece to complete the whole. With each society interpreting it differently. This has led the Nexus Ingenium to branch off into conflicting ideologies. Each using these new tablets to reinterpret the original Nexus Ingenium. Branching sects include the Pax Ingenium and the Verum Ingenium
\
	
### Pax Ingenium
A sect that believes that the Outsiders were not inherently evil but that the ancestors let greed and lust for power turn them into murderers. They misused the technology and it led to a mutual destruction of the outsiders as well as most of the ancestors civilization. They learned from their hubris and chose to live their lives to promote inner peace and prosperity for all.

### Verum Ingenium
Those who interpret the inherent strength in people as originating from a select few. This manifests as sorcerers of magic. Additionally the ancestors specifically from the region that would become Vey-Ruma are believed to be the first mages that overthrew the tyrannical Outsiders. This would mean all who hail from the Vey-Ruma empire and who possess magic are chosen people who will lead humanity into a new age. All others are lesser, or worse, heretics.

### Vox Historia
A guild of scientists, researchers, archaeologists, and historians who aren't preoccupied by a cosmological view of the outsiders. They are much more interested in the loss of history, technology, and writing from that period and wish to study Outsider and xeno-formed please without the prejudice of other religions.Â 
- They are publicly tolerated by the Pax Ingenium though privately they are wary of the guild's philosophy and worry of the temptation of greed without a religious centering.

- the Verum Ingenium outwardly calls them heretics and have actively called for their arrest.
