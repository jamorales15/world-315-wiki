# Religion - The Vey

## Nexum Ingenium
The teaching that power comes innately from all individuals. It's most sacred text, the Nexus Ingenium, starts with the telling of the overthrow of the Outsiders who lured the ancestors with promises of powers from beyond and once tempted, used it to enslave them. Sadly this has devolved over the eons into different sects who view all foreigners as outsiders that may tempt their people with strange new ideas.
The tablet known as the Nexus Ingenium was found 300 years ago and translated as best it could however 50 years ago after an earthquake new tablets were found that act as incomplete Rosetta Stones, with no one willing to share their piece to complete the whole. With each society interpreting it differently. This has led the Nexus Ingenium to branch off into conflicting ideologies. Each using these new tablets to reinterpret the original Nexus Ingenium. Branching sects include the Paxas Ingenium and the Rüm Ingenium.

### Paxas Ingenium
A sect that believes that the Outsiders were not inherently evil but that the ancestors let greed and lust for power turn them into murderers. They misused the technology and it led to a mutual destruction of the outsiders as well as most of the ancestors civilization. They learned from their hubris and chose to live their lives to promote inner peace and prosperity for all.

### Rüm Ingenium
Those who interpret the inherent strength in people as originating from a select few. This manifests as sorcerers of magic. Additionally the ancestors specifically from the region that would become Veyrüm are believed to be the first mages that overthrew the tyrannical Outsiders. This would mean all who hail from the Vey-Ruma empire and who possess magic are chosen people who will lead humanity into a new age. All others are lesser, or worse, heretics.

The complete lack of casualties or damage at the hand of the Mother of Tempests was used as proof of Veyrüm's ordained superiority. This became the basis for their new religious doctrine after the first new tablets were excavated and translated.

### House Lavos - Stewards of Science and History
A guild of scientists, researchers, archaeologists, and historians who aren't preoccupied by a cosmological view of the outsiders. They are much more interested in the loss of history, technology, and writing from that period and wish to study Outsider and xeno-formed please without the prejudice of other religions. 
- They are publicly tolerated by the Pax Ingenium though privately they are wary of the guild's philosophy and worry of the temptation of greed without a religious centering.

- the Vey Ingenium outwardly calls them heretics and have actively called for their arrest.

### Secret Cult of the Outsiders

Secretly there is another shadow organization at play. Their purpose is to safe guard the reactor and continue try to resurrect Outsider technology and biology to do their bidding and keep the kingdoms at war. The surviving Inspirational Party now exerts their will across multiple lands doing evil possessed shit. Each of them holding positions of power that are seemingly untouchable to any one man or kingdom. These possessed former Inspirational Party members are the regional leaders of the different sects of the secret Outsider Cult.
