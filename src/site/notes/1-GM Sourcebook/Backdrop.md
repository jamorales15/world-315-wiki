# World 315 - A System Lost to the Void
World 315 was lost to the greater galactic community when it's previous alien rulers, the Observers, were overthrown by the indigenous population. Now the entire system is in the "void", a pocket dimension created by the Outsiders for some unknown purpose.

#### What’s the name of this world for people in your scope?
Veylis (As in Volition)

#### Is magic present in this world? If yes, how common is it?
Magic is present in Veylis. In fact every individual has access to an internal source of magic called "[[3-World/The Vey\|The Vey]]". It requires rigorous training and study to do anything other than rudimentary physical augmentations in emotionally charged situations. (Augments might be slightly enhancing strength or changing one's hair color.) A single group of adventurers from the deep past were able to reach self-actualization with their Vey and became functionally immortal (like elves). 

#### Are natural physical laws mostly the same as in our world?
There are no stars in the sky other than their sun. Unbeknownst to the people, their solar system was banished into a void. Stars are only things rarely mentioned in pre "Void Out" Outsider texts.

Otherwise the natural laws are the same as any high fantasy world.

#### Are there any alternate dimensions generally associated with the world?
Other than the void pocket dimension the system of World 315 finds itself in, there is no great scientific or cosmological alternate plane of existence.

The closest would be the underground dwellings of Outsider facilities ravaged by time and xeno experimentation. These are societally referred to as "dungeons".

#### Are there any global-scale empires or groups that impinge on the campaign’s scope? 
- The Outsiders
	- While no longer alive, their machines and otherworldly xeno-formed flora and fauna still wreak havoc in certain self contained locations across the planet.
	- In reality the Outsiders are alive but are in the bodies of the 4 Heroes of Legend

#### How interconnected are the parts of your world?
The world is slightly smaller than Earth. It is divided by oceans and mountains and some sites of xeno-formed flora/fauna where only the boldest of adventurers trek.

Society is split into various regions with local city-states vying for control by one of many major houses. These regions are usually built inside of natural barriers near uncontaminated water sources. Most city-states are apprehensive of other nations.

Physical travel between regions is as taxing as early colonial efforts to travel to the newly discovered Americas on our Earth.

#### Is there a dominant [[3-World/Religion\|Religion]]? Who governs it?
The Ingenium. The teaching that power comes innately from all individuals. It's most sacred text, the Nexum Ingenium, starts with the telling of the overthrow of the Outsiders who lured the ancestors with promises of powers from beyond and once tempted, used it to enslave them. Sadly this has devolved over the eons into different sects who view all foreigners as outsiders that may tempt their people with strange new ideas.

Most nations are untrusting of each other. Cultural identities are maybe tied to 2-3 city-states within a single region who trade and interact with each other. Those outside that region may have different and varying interpretations of the Nexum Ingenium. Some even declaring other nations as heretics who must be converted or destroyed.

There are of course those who have become secular. Believing that although the Outsiders certainly existed, their destruction was of their own undoing. There wish is to learn from their mistakes and use their technology for the betterment of the world.

#### What are the important events in this world's timeline?
- The Mother of Tempests happened around 500 years ago. This extinction even led to the death of many plant, animal, and human life. Especially in and around the equator of Veylis. Every great civilization at that time collapsed. Their teachings of writing, mathematics, and art were lost. Smaller storms called Tempests have rocked the world every few weeks since that day. Those who help predict the next Tempest are called Tellers of the Tempests or just "Tellers"
- Around 400 years ago (100 years after the Mother of Tempests) The tablet and tableaus of the Nexum Ingenium was discovered a few years after in the dungeons that were unearthed from the Mother of Tempests. The surviving humans could not translate it but they could understand the drawings. Thus began the legend of the Outsiders and the heroes of legend.
- Around 200 years ago (300 years after the Mother of Tempests), a scientific expedition into one of these newly unearthed dungeons found what has become something of a Rosetta Stone for the Outsider's language. Now able to read the ancient Tablets and not just the pictures in the Tableaus, scholars of the time tried to rectify the legends of their ancestors to the history described in the Tablets. This led to the formal creation of the religion known as the Nexum Ingenium
- Around 50 years ago new tablets were found in newly unearthed dungeons. These have led to revelations which have splintered the Nexum Ingenium into various sects. The repercussions of this new information is still be reckoned with to this day.
