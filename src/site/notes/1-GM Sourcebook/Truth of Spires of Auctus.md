The Spires were made like Vey Bound concrete. Basically, instead of limestone, they used the bone meal of human sacrifices and bound their entire souls into the lifeless quarried rock. This is how they seemingly circumvented the law that only living things can use Vey. The Rüm Tablet included descriptions of enchanted items being made. They used Vey binding to create the spires. They did so on a level so evil and unheard of in the history of Veylis.
