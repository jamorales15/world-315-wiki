# What made these adventures sell-out?

What corporate entity invaded their spirit and caused this turn of character

How does this reflect on how each party members possessed spirit interacts with the world now?

### The Bard becomes a stereotypical sellout.
Finding hypnotic appeal though carefully calculated, psychological proven music that entrances the most people. This and a new system of viewing there music through exclusive and expensive balls where specially authorized "proxy bards" play the Bard's music. This makes them much profit and effectively removes any chance of independent bards from finding work to support their families. All noble houses simply request performances from proxy bands of the Bard and are blessed by its magic. The Bard himself hasn't made an original song in years. Simply relying on his backlog of mass market hits.

### The Cleric becomes a sellout to Rüm Ingenium. 
Aligning themselves with a religion that actively spouts fascist, nationalistic, and malevolent rhetoric all because it affords the Cleric access to powerful friends and profit. It also gives them access to an unheard of scale of worshippers who may in fact be more loyal to the Cleric than the Verum empire.

### The Wizard becomes a black market arms dealer
an underground enchanted weapon maker and supplier. 
Affordimg the Wizard profit from their military industrial complex. They also have a direct hand in the moving of geo-politcal trends. Instigating conflict where needed to increase profit. Since non living things cannot contain Vey, He is creating these enchanted weapons using a magic system invented outside the planet Veylis. To anyone else it would look like the Wizard is using the Outsider's technology to create alien weapons. In actually he is speaking in his native tongue to cast spells as well as using ingredients and alchemy invented on his native planet to enchant weapons with magic.

### The Rogue is a special case...
In the beginning the The Sellout Party wanted to use their new found bodies to continue their work as usual. However the Rogue in just a few days/weeks lost their immortality and most of their power because of an unknown rule of magic. The ideology that powers their powers comes from the ideology of the host body, not the Lich's ideology. The others 3 (Bard, Cleric, Wizard) realize that the Rogue's ideology (Steal from the rich to give to the poor) is so antithetical to a Corporate ideology that the body lost its powers incredibly quickly. This gave time for the other 3 to course correct and corrupt the ideology of their hosts. Making them sellouts that still fulfill the original rule of each possessed party member. Just in a twisted way. A loophole basically. 

The Rogue is humbled by this and fries a fondness for adventures who he sees as better people than him. He is secretly the friend who died whose funeral the PCs attend at the beginning of the game.

The Rogue secretly was working against the other 3 in secret but was actually found out all these centuries later and was killed by them.
