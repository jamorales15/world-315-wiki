Volition: First Contact

Independent colonists arrive on a new planet designated World 315. It has an alien surface of blue and purple flora, crystalline minerals and even fauna with crystal shells and carapaces. The bodies of water are strange Ruby color. The trees have a fairly mundane bark but wood of purple, almost Amethyst, coloring on the inside.

The colonists name this planet Volition after their spirit to find and cultivate new home for themselves.

It is eventually learned of the power Volition gives to living things, the Vey.

Colonists begin to experience small powerful new abilities. (akin to folk magic system in Mythras)

Outside corporate liches, the outsiders, find the planet and offer to buy it from the colonists.
  
Some form of trickery happens and the liches terraform the planet the way we see it today. This process kills many of the colonists. All this some my the lights in an effort to make the planet more habitable to the rich in the galactic community who live on more earth like planets. War breaks out and it begins clear that the Liches won't be able to keep the planet as a tourist attraction so they simply use it for fuel? A group of heroes, the Heroes of Legend, go to stop these Outsiders from destroying the planet completely.

The heroes go to the Central continent and confront the Outsiders as their machine attempts to siphon the Vey at the center of the planet.

The machine is partially destroyed as it explodes and energy causes the Mother of Tempests, destroying and shattering the central continent.

That event took place 500 years ago from the beginning of the game. It sent the world into a dark age where civilization fell and humans forgot basic writing, technology, and their own history. The rest of history is told as shown in the [[1-GM Sourcebook/Backdrop\|Backdrop]]
