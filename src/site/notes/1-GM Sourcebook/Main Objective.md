The inspirational Hero party of legend is a story of great adventurers who did great deeds and went on multiple adventures hundreds of years ago. In this legend they eventually found a way to perfect the energy within themselves and became ageless (like elves in other fantasies). This is how they existed in relatively youthful bodies 300 years ago and still do now. In reality they were in their 30s and 40s when they achieved functional immortality.

The power of the planet Remidira is held in the center of the depths of the lost continent. Building up over time due to it getting used by the outsiders as a planet sized reactor, it eventually became super critical and needed released. The Inspirational Hero finds out about this from the kingdom of what would become the lost continent. They and their party venture to the continent to investigate. They don't know if releasing the energy might not just blow up the planet or otherwise kill everyone. They look for ways to contain the power but it is eventually proven fruitless.

  

The inspirational hero and their party go to the center of the planet Remidira where the reactor controls are located. They go to turn it off in a desperate attempt to save the planet but are stopped by the ancient spirits of the Outsider Council. Those spirits attempt and successfully dominate the will of every party member accept the Inspirational Hero. The party members kill the hero. The lieutenant even tries to kill themselves by stabbing themselves in the chest with their great sword but the lead Outsiders spirit who ensnares the lieutenant's body uses their unique necromantic powers to simply bring the body back to life. The lieutenant now completely possessed delivers the killing blow to the Inspirational Hero.

  

The reactor overloads sending out a shockwave that caused the Mother of Tempests. The reactor itself still lays intact, protected by science and magic of the outsiders. The little Tempests since then are from the reactor slowly building up enough critical energy that will eventually shatter the planet. The Outsiders do not care about the destruction of this world. They simply want to squeeze out every last juice of power for their profit. They have done this to a multitude of planets across the galaxy and are simply employees of a larger galactic energy conglomerate. Their spirits will survive the blast unless someone somehow destroys their phylactery. Which is off this planet and on another planet in the solar system. 

  

Meanwhile the possessed party of the inspirational hero survived by teleporting off the continent as the Outsider council had planned. They tricked the kingdom of the lost continent to send for these renowned heroes in exchange for some lie of power. The party now exerts their will behind a veil of secrecy and puppet monarchs across multiple lands doing evil possessed shit. These possessed members are also the regional leaders of the different sects of the secret Outsider Cult. Each of them holding positions of power that are seemingly untouchable to any one man or kingdom. To the PC party it would seem the Inspirational Hero's party betrayed the hero and murdered him. 

The PC party didn't know the Inspirational Hero. But an adventurer and hero working with House Lavos in the historia society was known to the PC party. This adventurer scientist was a lifelong fan of the inspirational hero and their party. They spent their life in pursuit of learning what happened to them, never believing they were truly dead. The adventure scientist found out that the immortal party killed the inspirational hero and so the adventure scientist was killed for knowing to much. Before they died the adventure scientist had a message prepared for each PC, knowing they would meet with house Lavos for the funeral. This is where they learn the plot. There they decide to avenge their friend the adventurer scientist with the help of house Lavos. Sending them on a quest of vengeance. They must build their strength and the strength of their guild to have to power necessary to take down the killers of their friend. Forming alliances with noble houses, other guilds, and kingdoms to gain connections and access to these Betrayers. All while also becoming strong enough to take down these once great heroes of legend.

One of the first major steps is to get house Lavos a seat at the embassy of Thorns

  

All this to find out the truth near the end. That the Inspirational Hero wasnt betrayed. That they will have to make a choice whether or not to shut down the reactor which will definitely kill everyone in the room, or let it explode killing many but possibly letting them survive from a remote location. They will have to overcome the mind control attempts just as their heroes did.

  

The necromantic big bad's final attempt to stop them might even be a reanimated Inspirational Hero under his control.

  

Maybe the Hero's last act after they are defeated is to guide the party to a spaceship that takes them away from the reactor as it releases it's energy. This saves the party and also allows then to travel through space to the planet where the phylacteries are and destroy them.

The Mother of Tempests happened around 300 years ago, not 50. The Nexum Ingenium was discovered a few years after. They first dungeons were unearthed during the Mother of Tempests. As well as the Xeno swamp places 

  

The inspirational Hero party of legend eventually found a way to perfect the energy within themselves and became ageless like elves. This is how they existed in relatively youthful bodies 300 years ago and still do now. In reality they were in their 30s and 40s when they achieved functional immortality.
