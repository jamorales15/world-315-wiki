***Take on Missions:***

2. Attend a Ball

3. Navigate to and Explore an isolated town/village/location

4. Failure of a mission sometimes leads to new missions PCs aren't prepared for. Ex: Escape prison

5. Some missions unlock new downtime actions such as improvement opportunities

2. Actually include, crafting, learning, contacts, etc.


***Roll for the Company Action***

1. Take stock of new advantages from missions

2. Successful actions drive a BBEG out of hiding
