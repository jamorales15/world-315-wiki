The ability to make enchanted items was lost 500 years after the Mother of Tempests plunged Veylis into a dark age. Before this time binding items was a difficult and extremely costly process, but it WAS possible.

### Requirements:

- At least 10% of the object must be made from organic material
	- Examples would be wood, bone meal, plant fibers, leather, etc.
	- The higher the percentage of organic material the higher the possible magical output
	- The closer the material is to human, the more powerful it is
	- Too much organic material risks a fragile object. Iron more durable than wood/hemp
- A piece of a human's Vey
	- The minimum piece necessary small but not entirely negligible
	- Normally the one making the sacrifice is the one who will use the enchantment
		- This is called Vey Binding
	- While Vey Bonded, the item can be summoned to the person at will
	- While not in the user's possession they will slowly begin to wither
	- Higher Vey used = More power BUT Greater cost to humanity and quicker withering
